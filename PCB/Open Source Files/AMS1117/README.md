### PCBWay Sponsorship & Quality Review

These boards were kindly sponsored by PCBWay

🟢 Quality: The PCBs arrived with sharp silkscreen, smooth edges, and consistent solder mask — even for the fine-pitch pads.

🟢 Service: Communication with the PCBWay team (special thanks to Liam 🙏) was very fast and helpful at every step.

🟢 Delivery: The shipping was reliable and the boards were safely packed.

I haven’t soldered components yet (waiting for my kit to arrive), but I’m already impressed with the build quality. Once assembly and testing are complete, I’ll share performance measurements and final photos.
**⚙️ Typical Specs (AMS1117-3.3 based) :**

Output: 3.3 V fixed

Input: (commonly) ≥ 4.5 V up to around 12 V (observe power dissipation!)

Dropout: ~1.1–1.3 V (load-dependent)

Max current: up to 1 A electrically, but thermally limited by SOT-223 and copper area

Thermal tip: Keep large copper under/around the tab (pin 2) for heat spreading; derate current for higher VIN–VOUT.

**🧠 How the Circuit Works :**

Input (J1) receives unregulated DC.

C1/C2 provide input bulk and high-frequency decoupling close to U1.IN.

U1 (AMS1117-3.3) regulates to 3.3 V at U1.OUT.

C3/C4 provide output bulk and HF bypass close to U1.OUT for stability and transient response.

LED D1 + R1 connect to the 3.3 V output as a power-good indicator.

Output (J2) provides the regulated 3.3 V and GND to your load.
